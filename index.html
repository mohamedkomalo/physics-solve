									This game was created in <a href="http://Koding.com/Hackathon">Koding.com/Hackathon</a>. It is just a very basic demo of our idea.
								</p>

								<p>
									Physics games are fun and beneficial, but the problem is that most (if not all) rely on approximating the result in order to solve the game. For example, in Angry Birds players try to approximate the best angle and power to throw the bird with. In addition, during playing Angry Birds, players doesn't know anything about the physics concepts they apply when approximating the angle and power of the throw.
								</p>

								<p>
									However, explaining the physics concept with the help of angry birds will be easier, since players already have thought and tried to approximate the solution of the game.
								</p>

								<p>
									So why not combining both ? what if physics games were like any other games that is played because it is fun and challenging, but also there's explanation about the concept, and how to calculate the solution. of course, in order to do that, the game has to provide data. for example, in the case of Angry Birds, this data might be the current chosen angle and force for throwing the bird and the gravity. This way, players can actually calculate a solution and try it in the game.
								</p>

								<p>
									Here we illustrate a simple physics problem through a game where there is a flying object with velocity, we need to fire a rocket with an engine that produces force F at a certain time to hit this flying object.
								</p>

								<p>
									We have put some false targets flying and also different levels to add some fun in the game =D.

							What we want to know is what force we will set the engine of the rocket, and when we will power up the engine so that it hits the target.
								F = m a
							</p>

							<p>
							since mass of the rocket is given in the game 0.2kg, what we need to find is the acceleration.
							we can find it using kinematic equations:
								s = vo t + 1/2 a t^2
							</p>

							<p>
							well let's see, suppose that the object you to hit is at (x1, y1) and the rocket is at (x2, y2) then the point at which they meet will be (x2, y1)
							</p>

							<p>
							so when will the the target will arrive at this point, we already know at what speed it is moving
							t= d/v =>  (x2-x1) / velocity of object
							</p>

							<p>
							Now we know the object will be at the hitting point at time t, we would to be at this point also, so we want to move s = (y2-y1) , now we have s
							</p>

							<p>
							we can substitute in the equation
							s = vo t + 1/2 a t^2
							</p>

							<p>
							but take care you are going aganist the gravity, so the equation will be
							s = vo t + 1/2 (a-g) t^2

							then get a and calculate F = m * a
