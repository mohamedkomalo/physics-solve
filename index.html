									Physics games are fun and beneficial, but the problem is that most (if not all) rely on approximating the result in order to solve the game. For example, in Angry Birds players try to approximate the best angle and power to throw the bird with. In addition, during playing Angry Birds, players doesn't know anything about the physics concepts they apply when approximating the angle and power of the throw.
								</p>

								<p>
									However, explaining the physics concept with the help of angry birds will be easier, since players already have thought and tried to approximate the solution of the game.
								</p>

								<p>
									So why not combining both ? what if physics games were like any other games that is played because it is fun and challenging, but also there's explanation about the concept, and how to calculate the solution. of course, in order to do that, the game has to provide data. for example, in the case of Angry Birds, this data might be the current chosen angle and force for throwing the bird and the gravity. This way, players can actually calculate a solution and try it in the game.
								</p>

								<p>
									Here we illustrate a simple physics problem through a game where there is a flying object with velocity, we need to fire a rocket with an engine that produces force F at a certain time to hit this flying object.
								</p>

								<p>
									We have put some false targets flying and also different levels to add some fun in the game =D.

								What we want to know is what force to set in the engine of the rocket, and when we will power up the engine so that it hits the target. <br>

								Let's start thinking about the force, well F = m a <br>
								So we need the mass and acceleration, Since mass of the rocket is given in the game 0.2kg, what we need to find is the acceleration.<br>
								
							<p>
								we can find it using kinematic equation:
								s = vo t + 1/2 a t^2
							</p>

							<p>
								well let's see, suppose that the object you to hit is at (x1, y1) and the rocket is at (x2, y2) then the point at which they meet will be (x2, y1). See the example in the image.
							</p>

							<a href="hitpoint.png" target="_blank">
								<img src="hitpoint.png" width=400 style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:10px" />
							</a>

							<p>
								We need to know when when will the the target arrive at this point, we already know at what speed it is moving.
							</p>

							<p>
								t= d/v =>  (x2-x1) / velocity of object
							</p>

								NB: if it was moving in the oposite direction the velocity would be negative
							</p>

							<p>
								Now we know the object will be at the hitting point at time t, we want to be at this point at time t also to hit it, so we want to move from our position to the hit point s = (y2-y1) , now we have s
							</p>

							<p>
								we can substitute in the equation
								s = vo t + 1/2 a t^2
							</p>

							<p>
								but take care that the rocket are going aganist the gravity, so the equation will be
							</p>
								s = vo t + 1/2 (a-g) t^2<br>
								then get a and calculate F = ma
							</p>

							<p>
								Now we need to set the rocket's force to F, we need to fire when the flying object be at (x1, y1)
							</p>

							<p>
								Now choose a point and try to solve it then try it in the game, notice that you still need to be accurate to fire at the moment that object is at (x1, y1) not before or after it.
