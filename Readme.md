# physics-solve
A simple html5 game done during the [Koding.com Global Hackathon](http://Koding.com/Hackathon)

## Description

Physics games are fun and beneficial, but the problem is that most (if not all) rely on approximating the result in order to solve the game. For example, in Angry Birds players try to approximate the best angle and power to throw the bird with. In addition, during playing Angry Birds, players doesn't know anything about the physics concepts they apply when approximating the angle and power of the throw.

However, explaining the physics concept with the help of angry birds will be easier, since players already have thought and tried to approximate the solution of the game.

So why not combining both ? what if physics games were like any other games that is played because it is fun and challenging, but also there's explanation about the concept, and how to calculate the solution. of course, in order to do that, the game has to provide data. for example, in the case of Angry Birds, this data might be the current chosen angle and force for throwing the bird and the gravity. This way, players can actually calculate a solution and try it in the game.

Here we illustrate a simple physics problem through a game where there is a flying object with velocity, we need to fire at a certain time a rocket with an engine that has force F to hit this flying object.

We have put some false targets flying and also different levels to add some fun in the game =D.

## Adding your own levels
In game.js, the variable **levels** contains objects that describe each level, you can add a new level with your own level design
